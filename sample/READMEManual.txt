Setup
I'm using the Intellij IDE and it makes it easy for this project.
Open the folder to the Intellij project in your IDE
Make sure to have JavaFX libraries on your environment.
Add JavaFX Libraries to Project and add VM options with this command
    1. --module-path /Users/reza/Downloads/javafx-sdk-20/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
    2. --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-20/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

I also just added the executable just in case. It is in the OSFinalProjectAttempt_jar folder.

Running
When running the Simulator make sure that you first PAUSE the simulation then wait for all threads to
pause. (You can just wait 1 second after you pause)
Then you can click stop on the simulation.
You can run anything of the provided CPU Scheduling Algorithms.
